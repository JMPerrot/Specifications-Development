# Specifications-Development-
In this repository, we will submit programs to establish specifications for the development of leaf-clip optical sensore dicated to the monitoring of leaf biochemical content.
The PROSPECT Model is used with ANGERS database to simulate different configurations to find an optimal set of optical parameters.
