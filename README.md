# Specifications-Development-
In this repository, we will submit programs to establish specifications for the development of leaf-clip optical sensore dicated to the monitoring of leaf biochemical content.
The PROSPECT Model is used with ANGERS database to simulate different configurations to find an optimal set of optical parameters.
## Reference : Initial situation and goal
### Initial situation
spectral range : [400-900] nm for chlorophyll (CHL) and carotenoid (CAR)

                 [1300-2400] nm for equivalent water thickness (EWT) and leaf mass per area (LMA)

spectral range : [700-720] nm for chlorophyll (CHL)
                 [-]carotenoid (CAR)
                 [1300-2400] nm for equivalent water thickness (EWT) and leaf mass per area (LMA)

## R&T

### First step : Sampling stepping

### Second step : Sampling translation
